# Activity-JS-fundamentals-react-nextjs-Components
Basic styling and proper component structure

in part A: I simply created html and js to show the js fundamentals

in part b: I used nextjs and css. In the src folder I created 3 folders named welcome card, counter, and student info

in the src folder, in the page.js and layout.js, it is there where i created the homepage in which the user can access the 3 functional react components. 
Welcome card folder: page.js, welcome.css
projcounter folder: page.js, counter.css
studentinfo folder: page.js, student.css
